I solve data-related problems. I use data science and full-stack data development tools to generate analysis and applications. I follow an agile, test-driven development methodology. My preferred toolset is as follows:
<br>
<br>

<ul class='dl-horizontal'>
	<dt>Languages</dt>
	<dd>Primarily Python and R, with Bash to glue it all together.</dd>
	<dt>Web Frameworks</dt>
	<dd>Python's Django and Flask</dd>
	<dt>Visualization Libraries</dt>
	<dd>R's ggplot2 and Python's matplotlib for static visualizations. <br>
		Python's Bokeh and JavaScript's D3 for dynamic visualizations. <br>
		Python's Bokeh for dashboards.</dd>
	<dt>Big Data Tools</dt>
	<dd>Pig and Scalding are my preferred Map Reduce abstraction layers. <br>Together with Python, R, and Bash, I have experience utilizing these tools <br>
	within the Hadoop File System to make large amounts of data manageable.</dd>
	<dt>Back End</dt>
	<dd>Nginx, Gunicorn, MySQL-driven databases</dd>
	<dt>Version Control</dt>
	<dd>Git, Subversion </dd>
	<dt>Testing Frameworks</dt>
	<dd>Selenium </dd>
</ul>

However, I have experience with other technologies and am always happy to work with the stack that is best suited for the job at hand.

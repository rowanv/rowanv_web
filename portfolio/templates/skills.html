I solve data-related problems. I use data science and full-stack data development tools to generate analysis and applications. My toolset is as follows:
<br>

<ul>
	<li>Languages: Primarily Python, R, and Bash to glue it all together.</li>
	<li>Web Frameworks: Python's Django and Flask</li>
	<li>Visualization Libraries: R's ggplot2 and Python's matplotlib for static visualizations, Python's Bokeh and JavaScript's D3 for dynamic visualizations, Python's Bokeh for dashboards.</li>
	<li>Big Data Tools: Pig and Scalding are my preferred Map Reduce abstraction layers. Together with Python, R, and Bash, I have experience utilizing these tools within the Hadoop File System to make large amounts of data manageable. </li>
	<li>Back end: Nginx, Gunicorn, MySQL-driven databases </li>
</ul>

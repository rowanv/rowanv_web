I am a Freelance Python Full-Stack Data Developer. In short, I solve data-related problems.

My work in the past has primarily focused in data-related applications, including data science work, ETL pipelines, end-to-end ETL applications, dashboard creation, custom interactive visualizations, predictive modeling, and full stack Python web dev work with Django and Flask. I'm also proficient with big data tools (Pig, Scalding, etc.) used within the Hadoop ecosystem to obtain valuable, revenue-related insights.
